I was born and raised in Central Mexico where I was trained in mathematics and statistics during my bachelor and master’s degree studies, respectively. I got my Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Kansas at Lawrence, KS. My doctoral research focused on the problem of estimating the fundamental niche of a species from presence data. In this field, I am interested in studying species’ ecological niches (the match of a species to a specific environmental condition), its relationship with the areas of distribution of species, and how these might change due to human impacts. 

I am a postdoc at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa where I work under the supervision of [Jake Ferguson](https://www.jakeferguson.info/) on the statistical validation of sampling designs that account for imperfect detection of individuals to determine if these survey methods yield reliable estimates of population distribution and density.

I have broad research experience in statistical ecology and mathematical modeling for biology. You can read more about my research projects at the [Research](https://laurajim.github.io/research/) section, which includes a list of [my publications](https://laurajim.github.io/research/project0-publication-list).

I enjoy teaching and participating in outreach activities, activities that I've been practicing since I was an undergraduate student. Check out [my blog](https://laurajim.github.io/) to learn more about this,

Besides doing science, I love folding paper and creating beautiful geometric shapes of modular origami (check out [this gallery](https://laurajim.github.io/origami/) and my blog posts). I also like dancing and exploring nature. I currently live in the island of O'ahu in Hawaii which you can explore through [this gallery](https://laurajim.github.io/gallery/).
