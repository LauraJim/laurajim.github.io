I am a quantitative ecologist who studies how organisms’ responses to environmental gradients shape the geographic distributions of species and global biodiversity patterns. I have broad interests in quantitative ecology, though much of my recent work has focused on developing inferential methods to characterize species’ climatic niches and to predict the potential effects of climate change in reshaping species distributions or the potential spread of invasive species. Another focus of my research is comparing different methods to estimate species richness and population density under different sampling scenarios in order to identify ideal surveying and modeling strategies for future studies.
