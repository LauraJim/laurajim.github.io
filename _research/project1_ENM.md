In the field of Ecological Niche Modeling we study how organisms’ responses to environmental gradients shape the geographic distributions of species and global biodiversity patterns. Much of my recent work has focused on developing inferential methods to characterize species’ climatic niches and to predict the potential effects of climate change in reshaping species distributions or the potential spread of invasive species.
